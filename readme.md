# DNA Transcription Kata in Kotlin

This kata was picked up from
https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/dna-transcription-kata

I chose to perform the kata in Kotlin a language that I have been eyeing for a 
little while.  My first impressions are that it is a nice language that could
be great if it indeed picks up support in the front end (browsers) as well
as a JVM language.  Otherwise, I'd need to be convinced to move a development
team away from Java for it.  Personally, I would pursue it in more complex 
projects and then perhaps see the light.

The file main.kt contains most of the rather simple code.  I do represent
a GeneticCodeRepository (backed by /resources/genetic-codes/genetic-codes.json).

I did create some basic unit tests to make sure it is working but they are
far from exhaustive in my limitted time.

An interesting concept is that no explicit class is needed in the file. 
It could really take the flare of a scripting language.  I don't mind
wrapping things in classes sometimes, however, it is boilerplate.
